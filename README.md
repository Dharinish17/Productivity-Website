## 🚀 Hackathon Journey & Learning Experience

I've participated in the Innoquest#2 Hackathon and built TaskGamer as a productivity tool for daily task tracking and goal management.  

While developing this project, I explored several frontend libraries and gained hands-on experience in handling:

- *UI components*
- *Data persistence*
- *Third-party integrations (Charts, Calendar, PDF exports, etc.)*
- *Responsive web design*

This hackathon was a great learning experience and helped me improve my problem-solving, design thinking, and coding skills.
